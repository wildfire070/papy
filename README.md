A lightweight, user-friendly firmware fork for the **Xteink X4** e-paper display reader.
Built using **PlatformIO** and targeting the **ESP32-C3** microcontroller.

Papyrix is a fork of [CrossPoint Reader](https://github.com/daveallie/crosspoint-reader), focused on creating a light, streamlined reading experience with improved UI defaults.

## Motivation

E-paper devices are fantastic for reading, but most commercially available readers are closed systems with limited customisation. The **Xteink X4** is an affordable e-paper device, however the official firmware remains closed.

Papyrix aims to:
* Provide a **lightweight, open-source alternative** to the official firmware.
* Offer a **document reader** capable of handling EPUB content on constrained hardware.
* Support **customisable font, layout, and display** options.
* Run purely on the **Xteink X4 hardware**.

This project is **not affiliated with Xteink**; it's built as a community project.

## Installing

### Using Papyrix Flasher (Recommended)

The easiest way to install Papyrix is using [papyrix-flasher](https://github.com/bigbag/papyrix-flasher) — a cross-platform CLI tool with auto-detection and embedded bootloader. Download the latest release for your platform and run:

```bash
papyrix-flasher flash firmware.bin
```

### Manual Build

See [Development](#development) below.

## Development

### Prerequisites

* **PlatformIO Core** (`pio`) or **VS Code + PlatformIO IDE**
* Python 3.8+
* USB-C cable for flashing the ESP32-C3
* Xteink X4

### Checking out the code

Papyrix uses PlatformIO for building and flashing the firmware. To get started, clone the repository:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/pliashkou/papyrix

# Or, if you've already cloned without --recursive:
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Building

```sh
# Build firmware
make build

# Build release firmware
make release

# Or using PlatformIO directly
pio run
```

### Flashing your device

Connect your Xteink X4 to your computer via USB-C and run the following command.

```sh
make flash

# Or using PlatformIO directly
pio run --target upload
```

You can also flash using esptool directly (useful if you have a pre-built firmware binary):

```sh
esptool.py --chip esp32c3 --port /dev/ttyACM0 --baud 460800 \
  write_flash -z 0x0 firmware.bin
```

Replace `/dev/ttyACM0` with your device port (e.g., `COM3` on Windows, `/dev/tty.usbmodem*` on macOS).

### Creating sleep screen images

Convert any image to a sleep screen format compatible with Papyrix:

```sh
make sleep-screen INPUT=photo.jpg OUTPUT=sleep.bmp

# With options
make sleep-screen INPUT=photo.jpg OUTPUT=sleep.bmp ARGS='--dither --bits 8'
```

Options:
- `--orientation portrait|landscape` - Screen orientation (default: portrait)
- `--bits 2|4|8` - Output bit depth (default: 4)
- `--dither` - Enable Floyd-Steinberg dithering
- `--fit contain|cover|stretch` - Resize mode (default: contain)

Copy the output BMP to `/sleep/` directory or as `/sleep.bmp` on the SD card.

### Creating a GitHub release

```sh
# With auto-generated notes from commits
make gh-release VERSION=0.1.1

# With custom notes
make gh-release VERSION=0.1.1 NOTES="Release notes here"
```

### Generating changelog

Generate `CHANGELOG.md` from git tags and commit history:

```sh
make changelog
```

This creates a changelog grouped by version tags, with commit messages and author information.

## Internals

Papyrix is pretty aggressive about caching data down to the SD card to minimise RAM usage. The ESP32-C3 only has ~380KB of usable RAM, so we have to be careful. A lot of the decisions made in the design of the firmware were based on this constraint.

### WiFi and memory

The ESP32 WiFi stack allocates ~100KB and fragments heap memory in a way that cannot be recovered at runtime. After using WiFi features (File Transfer or OTA updates), XTC books require ~96KB of contiguous memory for page rendering. To ensure reliable operation, the device automatically restarts after exiting WiFi mode to reclaim memory.

### Performance optimizations

Papyrix includes several performance optimizations for the constrained ESP32-C3 environment:

**EPUB indexing**: Manifest item lookup uses an in-memory hash map for O(1) resolution of spine itemrefs. TOC-to-spine mapping also uses a hash map for O(1) href-to-index resolution. This reduces indexing time from O(n²) disk operations to O(n) memory lookups.

**XTC rendering**: 1-bit monochrome pages use byte-level processing instead of pixel-by-pixel iteration. All-white bytes (common in margins) are skipped entirely, and all-black bytes are processed in bulk.

### Data caching

The first time chapters of a book are loaded, they are cached to the SD card. Subsequent loads are served from the cache. This cache directory exists at `.papyrix` on the SD card. The structure is as follows:


```
.papyrix/
├── epub_12471232/       # Each EPUB is cached to a subdirectory named `epub_<hash>`
│   ├── progress.bin     # Stores reading progress (chapter, page, etc.)
│   ├── cover.bmp        # Book cover image (once generated)
│   ├── book.bin         # Book metadata (title, author, spine, table of contents, etc.)
│   └── sections/        # All chapter data is stored in the sections subdirectory
│       ├── 0.bin        # Chapter data (screen count, all text layout info, etc.)
│       ├── 1.bin        #     files are named by their index in the spine
│       └── ...
│
├── txt_98765432/        # Each TXT file is cached to a subdirectory named `txt_<hash>`
│   ├── progress.bin     # Stores current page number (4-byte uint32)
│   ├── index.bin        # Page index (byte offsets for each page start)
│   └── cover.bmp        # Cover image (if found in same directory as TXT file)
│
└── epub_189013891/
```

Deleting the `.papyrix` directory will clear the entire cache.

Due the way it's currently implemented, the cache is not automatically cleared when a book is deleted and moving a book file will use a new cache directory, resetting the reading progress.

For more details on the internal file structures, see the [file formats document](./docs/file-formats.md).
