# Fonts

Papyrix Reader supports custom fonts for reading. Fonts are converted to a proprietary `.epdfont` format optimized for e-paper displays.

## How Fonts Work

### Streaming Font System

Custom fonts use a memory-efficient **streaming** system that loads glyph bitmaps on-demand from the SD card rather than keeping the entire font in RAM. This saves approximately **50KB of RAM per font**.

- **Glyph metadata** (character metrics, positions) is loaded into RAM
- **Glyph bitmaps** (the actual pixels) are streamed from SD as needed
- An **LRU cache** keeps recently-used glyphs in memory for fast access
- Typical RAM usage: ~25KB per font (vs ~70KB for fully-loaded fonts)

This is transparent to users - fonts work the same way, just more efficiently.

### Supported Styles

Custom `.epdfont` fonts support **regular** and **bold** styles:

- **Regular** (`regular.epdfont`) - Required. Loaded when the book is opened.
- **Bold** (`bold.epdfont`) - Optional. Loaded on demand when bold text is first encountered, saving ~42KB of RAM for books that don't use bold.
- **Italic** text renders using the regular variant. When using built-in fonts, the native italic is used.

### Fallback Behavior

Papyrix ensures you can always read your books, even if a custom font fails:

1. **Font load failure** → Built-in font is used automatically
2. **Individual glyph failure** → Character is skipped gracefully (no crash)
3. **SD card read error** → Affected characters skipped, reading continues

If you notice missing characters, try switching to a different font in Settings. The built-in font is always available as a reliable fallback.

### Built-in Font Coverage

The built-in fonts include native support for:

- **Latin** - Western and Eastern European languages, including Vietnamese diacritics
- **Cyrillic** - Russian, Ukrainian, and other Cyrillic-script languages
- **Thai** - Full Thai script with proper mark positioning
- **Greek** - Modern Greek alphabet
- **Arabic** - Arabic script with contextual shaping and RTL layout

No custom fonts are needed for these scripts - they work out of the box.
