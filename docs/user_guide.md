# Papyrix User Guide

Welcome to the **Papyrix** firmware. This guide outlines the hardware controls, navigation, and reading features of
the device.

## 1. Hardware Overview

The device utilises the standard buttons on the Xtink X4 in the same layout:

### Button Layout

- **Bottom Edge:** Back, Confirm, Left, Right
- **Right Side:** Power, Volume Up, Volume Down

---

## 2. Power & Startup

### Power On / Off

To turn the device on or off, **press and hold the Power button for half a second**. In **Settings** you can configure
the power button to trigger on a short press instead of a long one.

### First Launch

Upon turning the device on for the first time, you will be placed on the **Home** screen.

> **Note:** On subsequent restarts, the firmware will automatically reopen the last book you were reading (configurable via **Startup Behavior** in Settings).

The Home Screen displays the app title "Papyrix Reader" at the top with a **battery indicator** in the top-right corner.

#### Book Card
The center of the screen features a **book card** - a dark rectangle with a bookmark icon at the top:
- **With a book open:** Displays the book title, author, and "Continue Reading" text
- **No book open:** Displays "No book open"

Press **Confirm** on the book card to continue reading your current book.

#### Menu Items
Below the book card are two bordered menu items:
- **Files** — Browse and select books from the SD card
- **Settings** — Device settings and file transfer

**Navigation:**
* Use **Left/Right** or **Volume Up/Down** to move between items
* Press **Confirm** to select an item

### 3.2 Book Selection (Files)

![File Browser](images/file-browser.jpg)

The Files screen acts as a folder and file browser.

* **Navigate List:** Use **Left** (or **Volume Up**), or **Right** (or **Volume Down**) to move the selection cursor up
  and down through folders and books.
* **Open Selection:** Press **Confirm** to open a folder or read a selected book.
* **Delete Item:** Press the **Right** button to delete the selected file or folder. A confirmation dialog will appear;
  select **Yes** to confirm deletion or **No** to cancel.

> **Note:** EPUB (.epub), XTC (.xtc, .xtch), Markdown (.md, .markdown), and plain text (.txt, .text) file formats are supported. EPUB 2 and EPUB 3 formats are fully supported. Markdown files render with basic formatting (headers, bold, italic, lists). The device supports both FAT32 and exFAT formatted SD cards.

> **Note:** The following folders are automatically hidden from the file browser:
> - `System Volume Information`, `LOST.DIR`, `$RECYCLE.BIN` — OS system folders
> - `config` — Papyrix configuration files
> - `XTCache` — XTC format cache
> - `sleep` — Custom sleep screen images
> - `.papyrix` — Internal cache (dot-prefix hidden by default)

> **Note:** Each folder can display up to 1000 items. Organize large libraries into subfolders if you exceed this limit.

> **Note:** You cannot delete the currently open book. Close the book first before deleting it.

See [4. Reading Mode](#4-reading-mode) below for more information.

### 3.4 File Transfer (Sync)

![File Transfer](images/file-transfer.jpg)

File transfer is accessible from the Home screen by pressing the **Left** button (or from the file browser, select **Sync**). This allows you to upload new e-books to the device over WiFi or connect to Calibre.

When you enter the screen, you'll be prompted to choose a network mode:

* **Join Network:** Connect to an existing WiFi network. You'll see a list of available networks and can enter passwords as needed. Previously saved networks will connect automatically.
* **Create Hotspot:** The X4 creates its own WiFi network that you can connect to directly from your computer or phone.

![On-screen Keyboard](images/keyboard.jpg)

Once connected, your X4 will start hosting a web server. See the [webserver docs](webserver.md) for more
information on how to connect and upload files.

> **Note:** When you exit File Transfer, the device will automatically restart to reclaim memory used by WiFi.

### 3.5 Settings

### 3.6 Calibre Wireless

Calibre Wireless allows you to send books directly from **Calibre** (the popular ebook management software) to your Papyrix Reader over WiFi. This is the fastest way to transfer books if you already use Calibre.

#### Prerequisites

- [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) installed on your computer
- Both devices on the same WiFi network

#### Connecting to Calibre

1. From the Home screen, press **Left** to access **Sync**, then select **Calibre Wireless**
2. Connect to your WiFi network (same as your computer)
3. The device will show its IP address and port (e.g., `192.168.1.42:9090`)
4. The screen displays "Waiting for Calibre..."

#### In Calibre Desktop

1. Click **Connect/Share** in the toolbar
2. Select **Start wireless device connection**
3. Calibre will automatically discover your Papyrix Reader
4. Your device appears as "Papyrix Reader" (or your custom name)

#### Sending Books

Once connected:
1. Right-click any book in Calibre
2. Select **Send to device > Send to main memory**
3. The book transfers wirelessly to your reader's `/Books/` folder

#### Bidirectional Sync

Calibre can also:
- **See your library** - View books already on your device
- **Delete books** - Remove books from the device remotely

#### Configuration

Customize settings via `/config/calibre.ini` on your SD card:

```ini
[Settings]
device_name = Papyrix Reader
password =
```

- **device_name**: How your device appears in Calibre
- **password**: Optional password (must match Calibre's wireless device password)

For detailed instructions, see the [Calibre Wireless Guide](calibre.md).

> **Note:** When you exit Calibre Wireless, the device will automatically restart to reclaim memory used by WiFi.

### 3.7 Sleep Screen

![Sleep Screen](images/sleep-screen.jpg)

You can customize the sleep screen by placing custom images in specific locations on the SD card:

- **Single Image:** Place a file named `sleep.bmp` in the root directory.
- **Multiple Images:** Create a `sleep` directory in the root of the SD card and place any number of `.bmp` images
  inside. If images are found in this directory, they will take priority over the `sleep.bmp` file, and one will be
  randomly selected each time the device sleeps.

> [!NOTE]
> You'll need to set the **Sleep Screen** setting to **Custom** in order to use these images.

#### Image Parameters

- **Resolution:** 480 × 800 pixels (portrait mode)
- **Color depth:** 8-bit grayscale or 24-bit color
- **Format:** BMP, uncompressed (BI_RGB)
- **Display levels:** 4 grayscale (black, dark gray, light gray, white)

> [!TIP]
> - Use 8-bit grayscale for best results - it's widely supported by image editors
> - Larger images will be automatically scaled down while preserving aspect ratio
> - All color images are converted to 4-level grayscale on the e-ink display

> [!TIP]
> The **Cover** sleep screen option displays the cover of the currently open book when the device sleeps.
