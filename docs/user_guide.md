---

## 2. Power & Startup

## 3. Screens

### 3.1 Home Screen

The Home Screen displays the app title "Papyrix Reader" at the top with a **battery indicator** in the top-right corner.

#### Book Card
The center of the screen features a **book card** - a dark rectangle with a bookmark icon at the top:
- **With a book open:** Displays the book title, author, and "Continue Reading" text
- **No book open:** Displays "No book open"

Press **Confirm** on the book card to continue reading your current book.

#### Menu Items
Below the book card are two bordered menu items:
- **Files** — Browse and select books from the SD card
- **Settings** — Device settings and file transfer

**Navigation:**
* Use **Left/Right** or **Volume Up/Down** to move between items
* Press **Confirm** to select an item

### 3.2 Book Selection (Files)

The Files screen acts as a folder and file browser.

* **Navigate List:** Use **Left** (or **Volume Up**), or **Right** (or **Volume Down**) to move the selection cursor up
  and down through folders and books.
* **Open Selection:** Press **Confirm** to open a folder or read a selected book.

> **Note:** Both EPUB (.epub) and XTC (.xtc, .xtch) file formats are supported. EPUB 2 and EPUB 3 formats are fully supported. The device supports both FAT32 and exFAT formatted SD cards.

### 3.3 Reading Screen

See [4. Reading Mode](#4-reading-mode) below for more information.

### 3.4 File Transfer

File transfer is accessible from **Settings > File transfer**. This allows you to upload new e-books to the device over WiFi.

When you enter the screen, you'll be prompted to choose a network mode:

* **Join Network:** Connect to an existing WiFi network. You'll see a list of available networks and can enter passwords as needed. Previously saved networks will connect automatically.
* **Create Hotspot:** The X4 creates its own WiFi network that you can connect to directly from your computer or phone.

Once connected, your X4 will start hosting a web server. See the [webserver docs](webserver.md) for more
information on how to connect and upload files.

> **Note:** When you exit File Transfer, the device will automatically restart to reclaim memory used by WiFi.

### 3.6 Sleep Screen

You can customize the sleep screen by placing custom images in specific locations on the SD card:

- **Single Image:** Place a file named `sleep.bmp` in the root directory.
- **Multiple Images:** Create a `sleep` directory in the root of the SD card and place any number of `.bmp` images
  inside. If images are found in this directory, they will take priority over the `sleep.bmp` file, and one will be
  randomly selected each time the device sleeps.

> [!NOTE]
> You'll need to set the **Sleep Screen** setting to **Custom** in order to use these images.

#### Image Parameters

- **Resolution:** 480 × 800 pixels (portrait mode)
- **Color depth:** 8-bit grayscale or 24-bit color
- **Format:** BMP, uncompressed (BI_RGB)
- **Display levels:** 4 grayscale (black, dark gray, light gray, white)

> [!TIP]
> - Use 8-bit grayscale for best results - it's widely supported by image editors
> - Larger images will be automatically scaled down while preserving aspect ratio
> - All color images are converted to 4-level grayscale on the e-ink display

> [!TIP]
> The **Cover** sleep screen option displays the cover of the currently open book when the device sleeps.
