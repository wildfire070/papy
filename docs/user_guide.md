Once connected, your X4 will start hosting a web server. See the [webserver docs](webserver.md) for more
information on how to connect and upload files.

### 3.6 Net Library

Net Library allows you to browse and download books directly from any [OPDS](https://opds.io/)-compatible server running on your local network. OPDS (Open Publication Distribution System) is an open standard supported by many ebook servers including:

- **Calibre Content Server** — Built into Calibre
- **COPS** — Calibre OPDS (PHP Server)
- **Kavita** — Self-hosted digital library
- **Komga** — Media server for comics/manga
- **Feedbooks** — Public domain books

#### Getting Started

On first launch, **Project Gutenberg** is preconfigured as a default server, giving you immediate access to over 70,000 free public domain ebooks.

#### Adding More Servers

Servers are configured via the `/opds.ini` file on your SD card:

1. Insert the SD card into your computer
2. Open or create `/opds.ini` in the root directory
3. Add servers using the INI format:

```ini
[My Calibre Server]
url = http://192.168.1.100:8080/opds
username = myuser
password = mypassword
```

> **Tip:** For Calibre, enable the content server in Preferences > Sharing over the net, then use `http://your-ip:8080/opds` as the URL.

#### Browsing Books

1. Select a configured server from the list
2. The device will connect via WiFi (you'll be prompted to select a network if not connected)
3. Navigate through catalogs using **Left/Right** or **Volume Up/Down**
4. Press **Confirm** to enter a catalog or download a book
5. Press **Back** to go up one level

#### Supported Formats

Books are downloaded in EPUB format. If a book doesn't have an EPUB version available, it cannot be downloaded.

#### Managing Servers

To add, edit, or remove servers, modify the `/opds.ini` file on your SD card.

Downloaded books are saved to the `/Books/` folder on your SD card.

> **Note:** When you exit Net Library, the device will automatically restart to reclaim memory used by WiFi.

### 3.7 Sleep Screen

![Sleep Screen](images/sleep-screen.jpg)

You can customize the sleep screen by placing custom images in specific locations on the SD card:

- **Single Image:** Place a file named `sleep.bmp` in the root directory.
- **Multiple Images:** Create a `sleep` directory in the root of the SD card and place any number of `.bmp` images
  inside. If images are found in this directory, they will take priority over the `sleep.bmp` file, and one will be
  randomly selected each time the device sleeps.

> [!NOTE]
> You'll need to set the **Sleep Screen** setting to **Custom** in order to use these images.

#### Image Parameters

- **Resolution:** 480 × 800 pixels (portrait mode)
- **Color depth:** 8-bit grayscale or 24-bit color
- **Format:** BMP, uncompressed (BI_RGB)
- **Display levels:** 4 grayscale (black, dark gray, light gray, white)

> [!TIP]
> - Use 8-bit grayscale for best results - it's widely supported by image editors
> - Larger images will be automatically scaled down while preserving aspect ratio
> - All color images are converted to 4-level grayscale on the e-ink display

> [!TIP]
> The **Cover** sleep screen option displays the cover of the currently open book when the device sleeps.
